# Transformation matrix

*tmatrix* is a small pure C library for linear algebra. It is focused on cooridnate transformations and other robotics specific tasks. 

The library includes following parts:
* _tmatrix.h_ - main definitions and matrix operations.
* _tmatrix\_vec.h_ - vector specific operations.
* _tmatrix\_homo.h_ - homogenous transformations and specific simplifications.
