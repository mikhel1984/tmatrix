# Transformation matrix

**tmatrix** is a small pure C library for linear algebra. It is focused on coordinate transformations and other robotics specific tasks. 

The library includes following parts:
* _tmatrix.h_ - main definitions and matrix operations.
* _tmatrix\_vec.h_ - vector specific operations.
* _tmatrix\_homo.h_ - homogenous transformations and specific simplifications. 
* _tmatrix\_io.h_ - object print, csv reading and writing.
* _tmatrix\_rot.h_ - operations with rotation matrices and quaternions.
